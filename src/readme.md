SongTangle is a web application developed with Laravel by lxndrtsh. The site is owned and operated by Alexander Howell and is currently in its second stage of development. Help contribute to the development of the application if you so feel like it, leave comments on the Wiki, or fork us. The application is a RESTful API layer that will speak with a frontend, and that piece of development has not been started.

Please watch this repository for updates on the status of the project.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
